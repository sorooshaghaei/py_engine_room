# App Template

Use this template when your project has a clear entrypoint (CLI/job/service).

## Included patterns

- Thin `main.py` entrypoint
- Config loader (`configs/config.yaml`)
- Reusable pipeline orchestrator (`run_pipeline`)
- Step classes isolated in `steps.py`
- Logging and metrics
- Smoke tests
