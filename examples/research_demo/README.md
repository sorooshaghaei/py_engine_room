# Research Demo

Use this template when exploration starts in notebooks, while keeping reusable logic in `src/`.

## Included patterns

- Notebook-first workflow with extraction to modules
- Thin `main.py` for reproducible batch runs
- Shared pipeline scaffold and tests
- Data/output boundaries and config-driven runs
